This is the README file for the R project of this chapter. 
The organization of this R project contain three main folders:
1. Data
2. Outputs
3. Scripts

## Data
The data folder is divided into two subfolders, _Raw_ and _Processed_. Raw data is all the data collected from the field. The processed folder contained any changes to the data, data wrangling or corrections (NA cleaning or summary stats) that may be used for analysis. That is the ready-to-go datasets. 

## Output
Contains any results summary, usually PDFs for the results, figures, or JASP files (for quick data exploration).

## Scripts
Contains all the R scripts of the project. These scripts are numbered and are organized into sections. Each script has its description in the title and a brief introduction of what the code does. Here you will also find the R markdown file used to produce the outputs.
